# About

Provides a extensible plugin platform that easily integrates into the I2B2 WebClient application in order to provide additional functionality, such as:

* Integration into a Single Sign-On system.
* Data Usage Agreement
* Self-service user registration.
* What ever else you need.

The platform is intended to allow for the mix and match of plugins without requiring any code changes.  The usage of plugins is based on deployment of that plugin.
